docker ps -a -q		: to list container ids
docker kill $(docker ps -a -q) : to kill all containers 
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) : to remove all containers 

Note: In the above process all the containers are managed and created one by one in real time we manage all the containers at same time so for that purpose we are going to use the concept called Docker compose.


DOCKER COMPOSE:
It's a tool used to manage multiple containers in single host.
we can create, start, stop, and delete all containers together.
we write container information in a file called a compose file.
compose file is in YAML format.
inside the compose file we can give images, ports, and volumes info of containers.
we need to download this tool and use it.

INSTALLATION:
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
ls /usr/local/bin/
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose version


In Linux majorly you are having two type of commands first one is inbuilt commands which come with the operating system by default 
second one is download commands we are going to download with the help of yum, apt or Amazon Linux extras.
some commands we can download on binary files.

NOTE: linux will not give some commands, so to use them we need to download seperately
once a command is downloaded we need to move it to /usr/local/bin
because all the user-executed commands in linux will store in /usr/local/bin
executable permission need to execute the command



vim docker-compose.yml

version: '3.8'
services:
  movies:
    image: movies:v1
    ports:
      - "81:80"
  train:
    image: train:v1
    ports:
      - "82:80"
  dth:
    image: dth:v1
    ports:
      - "83:80"
  recharge:
    image: recharge:v1
    ports:
      - "84:80"

COMMANDS:
docker-compose up -d		: to create and start all containers
docker-compose stop		: to stop all containers
docker-compose start		: to start all containers
docker-compose kill		: to kill all containers
docker-compose rm		: to delete all containers
docker-compose down		: to stop and delete all containers
docker-compose pause		: to pause all containers
docker-compose unpause		: to unpause all containers
docker-compose ps -a		: to list the containers managed by compose file
docker-compose images		: to list the images managed by compose file
docker-compose logs		: to show logs of docker compose
docker-compose top		: to show the process of compose containers
docker-compose restart		: to restart all the compose containers
docker-compose scale train=10	: to scale the service


CHANGING THE DEFULT FILE:

by default the docker-compose wil support the following names
docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.yaml, compose.yml, compose.yaml

mv docker-compose.yml raham.yml
docker-compose up -d	: throws an error

docker-compose -f raham.yml up -d
docker-compose -f raham.yml ps
docker-compose -f raham.yml down


images we create on server.
these images will work on only this server.

git (local) -- > github (internet) = to access by others
image (local) -- > dockerhub (internet) = to access by others

Replace your username 

STEPS:
create dockerhub account
create a repo

docker tag movies:v1 vijaykumar444p/movies
docker login -- > username and password
docker push vijaykumar444p/movies


docker tag train:v1 vijaykumar444p/train
docker push vijaykumar444p/train


docker tag dth:v1 vijaykumar444p/dth
docker push vijaykumar444p/dth

docker tag recharge:v1 vijaykumar444p/recharge
docker push vijaykumar444p/recharge

docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
docker pull vijaykumar444p/movies:latest

DOCKER SAVE:
docker image save swiggy:v1 > swiggy:v1.tar :covert image to file 
docker image history swiggy:v1
docker rmi swiggy:v1
docker images
docker image load < swiggy\:v1.tar

COMMAND TO ZIP:  gzip dummy:v5.tar abc.zip
DECOMPRESS COMMAND: gzip movies:latest.gz -d

COMPRESSING DOCKER IMAGE SIZE:
1. push to dockerhub
2. use multi stage docker build
3. reduce layers
4. use tar balls

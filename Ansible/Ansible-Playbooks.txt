 PLAYBOOKS:
 
playbooks used to execute multiple modules.
we can reuse the playbook multiple times.
in real time we use a playbook to automate our work.
for deployment, pkg installation, Server Creation ----
here we use key-value pairs.
Key-Value can also be called as Dictionary.
ansible-playbook will be written on YAML syntax.
YAML = YET ANOTHER MARKUP LANGUAGE
extension for playbook is .yml or .yaml
playbook start with --- and end with ... (opt)


EX-1:

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: installing git
      yum: name=git state=present

    - name: installing httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=present

    - name: starting httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started

    - name: create user
      user: name=jayanth state=present

    - name: copy a file
      copy: src=index.html dest=/root

   

TO EXECUTE: ansible-playbook playbok.yml

Gather facts: it will get information of worker nodes
its by default task performed by ansible.

ok=total number of tasks
changed= no.of tasks successfully executed

EX-2:
 hosts: all
  ignore_errors: true
  tasks:
    - name: installing git
      yum: name=git state=absent

    - name: installing httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=absent

    - name: starting httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started

    - name: create users
      user: name=pushpa state=absent

    - name: copying a file
      copy: src=raham.txt dest=/root


TAGS: by default ansible will execute all tasks sequentially in a playbook.
we can use tags to execute a specific tasks or to skip a specific tasks.


EX-1:

- hosts: all
  ignore_errors: yes
  tasks:
    - name: installing git
      yum: name=git state=present
      tags: a

    - name: installing httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=present
      tags: b

    - name: starting httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started
      tags: c

    - name: create a user
      user: name=kohli state=present
      tags: d

    - name: copy a file
      copy: src=index.html dest=/tmp
      tags: e

SINGLE TAG: ansible-playbook raham.yml --tags d
MULTI TAGS: ansible-playbook raham.yml --tags b,c

EX-2:

- hosts: all
  ignore_errors: yes
  tasks:
    - name: uninstalling git
      yum: name=git* state=absent
      tags: a

    - name: uninstalling httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=absent
      tags: b

    - name: starting httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started
      tags: c

    - name: delete a user
      user: name=kohli state=absent
      tags: d

    - name: copy a file
      copy: src=index.html dest=/tmp
      tags: e

SKIP A SINGLE TASK: ansible-playbook raham.yml --skip-tags c
SKIP MULTIPLE TASK: ansible-playbook raham.yml --skip-tags a,c


==========================================================

HANDLERS:
when we have two tasks in a single playbook if task 2 is depending upon task 1 so then we can use the concept called handlers .
once task one is executed successfully it will notify task 2 to perform the operation.
the name of the notify and the name of the task two must be same.


- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: installing httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=present
      notify: starting httpd
  handlers:
    - name: starting httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started

sed -i 's/present/absent/g' raham.yml

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: installing httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=absent
      notify: starting httpd
  handlers:
    - name: starting httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started

SETUP MODULE: used to print the complete info of worker nodes
ansible all -m setup

ansible all -m setup  | grep -i family
ansible all -m setup  | grep -i pkg
ansible all -m setup  | grep -i cpus
ansible all -m setup  | grep -i mem




How to disconnect the worker node from the ansible node?
ANS: in .ssh/ the workers information is going to stored. we have to remove the ip address of the worker node for disconnection of the worker node from the ansible server. 




---------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: 
sed -i 's/abesent/present/g' file_name: it is going to replace the word absent to present where present in the file. file_name = we need to provide the file_name in whcih we wanted to make changes.
